This is a full-stack project with a FastAPI backend (Python) and a Vite React frontend (JavaScript). The backend provides endpoints for crawling, scraping JS-rendered content, and previewing websites. The frontend interacts with these endpoints and displays results interactively. Always keep API contracts and CORS in mind when generating code for this workspace.
